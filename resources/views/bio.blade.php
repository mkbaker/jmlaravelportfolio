        <p>Born in Costa Mesa, California, Juliette identifies as a queer, mixed-race Chinese-American artist and has been making art ever since she was two years old. She believes that art is a tool for political resistance, healing, spiritual expansion, and individual and collective liberation.</p>
        <p>Juliette interweaves her personal experiences and observations of the world and current issues to make sense of the human experience through her art. She appreciates capturing the complex and often contradictory nature of human beings, and the fluidity as we move through the world and through our overlapping and intersectional identities. Juliette is inspired by stories of transition, movement, and unfolding of personal identity in her work. She believes art is a universal language, and she has used it all her life as her most authentic form of communication.</p>
